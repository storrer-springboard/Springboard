    "## Relational Database\n",
    "- A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.[1] \n",
    "- Relational databases store data in **tables**.\n",
    "- **Tables** are like a spreadsheet. They model data as rows and columns.\n",
    "> \"The relational model (RM) for database management is an approach to managing data using a structure and language consistent with first-order predicate logic, first described in 1969 by English computer scientist Edgar F. Codd,[1][2] where all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations. A database organized in terms of the relational model is a relational database.\"\n",

    "## Cluster\n",
    "Users are defined at a cluster-wide level, which means they are not tied to a particular database in the cluster. A user can connect with and manage any database in the cluster they have been allowed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schema\n",
    "A schema is a logical representation of a database including its tables/relations and their attributes.\n",
    "> \"A database can be organized into namespaces, called schemas. A schema is a mnemonic name that the user can assign to organize database objects, such as tables, into a more structured collection. Schemas cannot be nested, so they represent a flat namespace.\" - Learn PostgreSQL, pg 15\n",
