Part II
man is a command line interface for the system reference manuals
to scroll press the arrow keys or the space bar or the pag up and page down keys. to get out press q.
the -l flag for ls uses a long listing format
the -a flag means "do not ignore entries that start with a full stop (.)"
On my computer alt/option and the arrow keys doesn't do anything at all. I wish I had a Mac because then I wouldn't waste so much time trying things that don't apply to my OS.
To jump between words on my Windows machine I press control + arrow keys. (the terminal handout says I am supposed to press the alt + arrow keys)
Control + e jumps to the end of the line
control + a " " " beginning of the line
control + w deletes the word under the cursor
A shell is the program that actually processes commands and returns output. Shells also manage background and foreground proceses.
A terminal is a 'wrapper program' that runs the shell.
An absolute path is specified starting from the root directory: /
A relative path is specified relative to the current working directory.
A flag is an option that can be passed to a command to change or enhance its effects. 
ls -a lists directory contents including items starting with .
rm -rf removes a directory that is not empty'
ls -1 lists contents printing each entry on its own line
the -f flag tells the rm command to ignore nonexistent files and arguments, and to never prompt
the -r flag tells rm to remove directories and their contents recursively
