    "- A CTE, or a common table expression, is a temporary result taken from a SQL statement.\n",
    "- The lifetime of a CTE is equal to the lifetime of the query.\n",

    "# WITH Queries aka Common Table Expressions aka CTEs for PostgreSQL\n",
    "- These statements, which are often referred to as Common Table Expressions or CTEs, can be thought of as defining temporary tables that exist just for one query.\n",
    "- `WITH` provides a way to write auxiliary statements for use in a larger query. \n",
    "- Each auxiliary statement in a WITH clause can be a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE; and the WITH clause itself is attached to a primary statement that can also be a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.\n"
