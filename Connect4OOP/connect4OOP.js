/* Part One: Make Game Into a Class
Right now, our Connect Four is a bunch of disconnected functions and a few global variables.

This can make it hard to see how things work, and would make it hard to restart a game (quick—which variables would you have to reset to start a game?)

Let’s move this to being a class.

Initially, we’ll start with one class, Game. The players will still just be numbers for player #1 and #2.

What are the instance variables you’ll need on the Game?
for example: height, width, and the board will move from global variables to instance attributes on the class. What else should move?
Make a constructor that sets default values for these
Move the current functions onto the class as methods
This will require mildly rewriting some of these to change how you access variables and call other methods
You should end up with all of the code being in the Game class, with the only other code being a single line at the bottom:

new Game(6, 7);   // assuming constructor takes height, width
Part Two: Small Improvements
Make it so that you have a button to “start the game” — it should only start the game when this is clicked, and you should be able to click this to restart a new game.

Add a property for when the game is over, and make it so that you can’t continue to make moves after the game has ended.*/

// Part Three: Make Player a Class
// Right now, the players are just numbers, and we have hard-coded player numbers and colors in the CSS.

// Make it so that there is a Player class. It should have a constructor that takes a string color name (eg, “orange” or “#ff3366”) and store that on the player instance.

// The Game should keep track of the current player object, not the current player number.

// Update the code so that the player pieces are the right color for them, rather than being hardcoded in CSS as red or blue.

// Add a small form to the HTML that lets you enter the colors for the players, so that when you start a new game, it uses these player colors.

    constructor(color) {
      this.color = color;
